# Multiple-Dashboards


This project revolves around visualizing data in different ways.

The data source used is called "AdventureWorksDW2019". It's a sample database offered by Microsoft and can be found here: AdventureWorks sample databases - SQL Server | Microsoft Learn

In this project you will found 4 dashboards with 4 different styles. Each one revolves around one topic like sales, purchase, human resources and manufacturing. 

By using color, arrows and icons, you could give context to the KPI shown. With this context users can understand reports better and faster than without it.

The color and arrows used are dynamic so it shows if one KPI is good or bad without the user doing anything.
